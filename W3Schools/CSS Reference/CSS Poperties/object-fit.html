            <h1>CSS object-fit Property</h1>
                <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
                    <p>
                        The object-fit property is used to specify how an img or video should be resized to fit its container.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This property tells the content to fill the container in a variety of ways; such as "preserve
                        that aspect ratio" or "stretch up and take up as much space as possible".
                    </p>
                <h2>Css Syntax </h2>
                    <pre>
                        object-fit: fill|contain|cover|scale-down|none|initial|inherit;
                    </pre>
                <h2>Property Values</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>fill 
                            <p>This is default. The replaced content is sized to fill the element's content box. If
                                necessary, the object will be stretched or squished to fit
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>contain 
                            <p>
                                The replaced content is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the
                                element's content box
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>cover 
                            <p>
                                The replaced content is sized to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the element's
                                entire content box. The object will be clipped to fit
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>none 
                            <p>
                                The replaced content is not resized
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>scale-down 
                            <p>The content is sized as if none or contain were specified (would result in a smaller
                                concrete object size)</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
