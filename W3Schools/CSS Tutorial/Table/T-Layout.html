            <h1>CSS table-layout Property</h1>
            
            <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
                <p>
                    The table-layout property defines the algorithm used to lay out table cells, rows, and columns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tip: The main benefit of table-layout: fixed; is that the table renders much faster. On large
                    tables, users will not see any part of the table until the browser has rendered the whole table. So,
                    if you use table-layout: fixed, users will see the top of the table while the browser loads and
                    renders rest of the table. This gives the impression that the page loads a lot quicker!
                </p>

            <h2>Property Values</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>auto</li>
                        <p>Browsers use an automatic table layout algorithm. The column width is set by the widest
                            unbreakable content in the cells. The content will dictate the layout</p>

                    <li>fixed</li>
                        <p>
                            Sets a fixed table layout algorithm. The table and column widths are set by the widths of
                            table and col or by the width of the first row of cells.
                            Cells in other rows do not affect
                            column widths.
                            If no widths are present on the first row, the column widths are divided
                            equally across the table, regardless of content inside the cells
                        </p>
