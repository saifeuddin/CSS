            <h1>CSS The object-fit Property</h1>    
                <p>
                    The CSS object-fit property is used to specify how an img or video should be resized to fit its container.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This property tells the content to fill the container in a variety of ways;
                     such as 
                     "preserve that aspect ratio" or "stretch up and take up as much space as possible".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The object-fit property can take one of the
                    following values:
                    <ol>
                        <li>fill
                            <p>
                                This is default. The image is resized to fill the given dimension.
                                If necessary,
                                the image will be "stretched" or "squished" to fit.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>contain
                            <p>
                                The image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit within the given dimension.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>cover
                            <p>
                                The image keeps its aspect ratio and fills the given dimension. <br>
                                The image will be "clipped" to fit.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>none
                            <p>Image is not resized</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>scale-down
                            <p>
                                The image is scaled down to the "smallest version" of "none or contain"
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
