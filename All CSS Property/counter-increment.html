            <h1>CSS counter-increment Property </h1>
                <h3>Example</h3>
                    <pre>
                        body {
                        /* Set "my-sec-counter" to 0 */
                        counter-reset: my-sec-counter;

                        /* Increment "my-sec-counter" by 1 */

                        content: "Section " counter(my-sec-counter) ". ";
                        }
                    </pre>
                <h2>Definition and Usage </h2>
                    <p>
                        The counter-increment property increases or decreases the value of one or more CSS counters.
                    </p>
                    <b>The counter-increment property is usually used together with the counter-reset property and the
                        content property.</b>
                <br>
                <br>



                <h2>Syntax</h2> 
                    <pre>
            counter-increment: none | id | initial| inherit;
                    </pre>
                <br>  
                <br>
                
                

                <h2>Values </h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>none</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>id number 
                            <p>
                                The id defines which counter to increment. The number sets how much the counter will
                                increment on each occurrence of the selector. The default increment is 1. Negative
                                values are allowed. If id refers to a counter that has not been initialized by
                                counter-reset, the default initial value is 0
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                <br>
                <br>
