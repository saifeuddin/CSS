        <h2> ## Mask resets mask-border to its initial value</h2>
            <p>
                You might not see mask-border in the examples we’ve seen so far, but it’s still doing something in the
                background because mask resets mask-border to its initial value. Remember, mask-border is a shorthand
                property as well, so here’s how that breaks down:
            </p>
            <img src="mask-border.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                As such, the spec suggests using mask instead of the individual properties to override mask settings
                that pop up earlier in the cascade. That way, too, mask-border properties are properly reset to their
                initial values, allowing the styles declared later to work as expected.
