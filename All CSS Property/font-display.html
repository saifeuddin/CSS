            ## Css font-display Property </h1>
        <br>

        <p> <b>
                $$ --
            </b>
            The font-display property defines how font files are loaded and displayed by the browser. It is applied to
            the @font-face rule which defines custom fonts in a stylesheet.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>Example :</h3>
        <pre>
        <big>
        @font-face {
            font-family: 'MyWebFont'; 
                /* Define the custom font name */

            src: url('myfont.woff2') format('woff2'),
            url('myfont.woff') format('woff'); 
                /*Define where the font can be downloaded */


            font-display: fallback; 
                /* Define how the browser behaves during download */
        }
        </big>
        </pre>
    </div>








    <div style="border: 3px solid black; padding: 20px; margin: 40px 0;">
        <h1>## Values </h1>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>
                    auto
                </b>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>
                    block : <br>
                </b>
                Instructs the browser to briefly hide the text until the font has fully downloaded. More accurately, the
                browser draws the text with an invisible placeholder then swaps it with the custom font face as soon as
                it loads. This is also known as a “flash of invisible text” or FOIT.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>
                    swap : <br>
                </b>
                Instructs the browser to use the
                fallback font to display the text
                until the custom font has fully
                downloaded. This is also known as
                a “flash of unstyled text” or
                FOUT.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>
                    fallback : <br>
                </b>
                 Acts as a compromise between the auto and swap values. The browser will hide the text for about 100ms
                 and, if the font has not yet been downloaded, will use the fallback text. It will swap to the new font
                 after it is downloaded, but only during a short swap period (probably 3 seconds).
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <b>
                    optional : <br>
                </b>
                Like fallback, this value tells the browser to initially hide the text, then transition to a fallback
                 font until the custom font is available to use. However, this value also allows the browser to
                 determine whether the custom font is even used at all, using the user’s connection speed as a
                 determining factor where slower connections are less likely to receive the custom font.
            </li>
        </ul>
