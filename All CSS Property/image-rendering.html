        <h1>CSS image-rendering Property </h1>  
            <p>
                The image-rendering property defines how the browser should render an image if it is scaled up or down
                from its original dimensions. By default, each browser will attempt to apply aliasing to this scaled
                image in order to prevent distortion, but this can sometimes be a problem if we want the image to
                preserve its original pixelated form.
            </p>
            <pre>
                img {
                    image-rendering: auto;
                    image-rendering: crisp-edges;
                    image-rendering: pixelated;
                }
            </pre>


            <br>

            <h2>Values   </h2>  
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        auto 
                        <p>
                            auto: default value that uses the browser’s standard algorithm to maximize the appearance of
                            an image.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>crisp-edges:
                        <p>
                            The contrast, colors and edges of the image will be preserved without any
                            smoothing or blurring. According to the spec this was specifically intended for pixel art.
                            This value applies to images scaled up or down.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>pixelated 
                        <p>
                            As the image changes size the browser will preserve its pixelated style by using
                            nearest-neighbour scaling. This value only applies to images that are scaled up.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <img src="rendering.jpg" alt="">



                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This property can be applied to
                    <b>
                        background-images, canvas elements as well inline images. 
                    </b>
                    It’s
                    important to note however that testing these values at this time is particularly confusing because
                    of the lack of consistent browser support.
                </p>
