                The text-justify property in CSS is a companion to the text-align property that is used to set the justification method of text when text-align is set to the justify value.

                        Allows the browser to determine whether justification is better handled as inter-word or inter-character. This can be helpful in multi-lingual scenarios where the content language is unknown until rendered, allowing the browser user agent to choose accordingly based on which method better fits the language context.

                        Specifies that text is justified by adjusting the spacing between words, effectively creating additional word spacing. This is effectively a variation of the word-spacing property.

                        pecifies that text is justfiied by adjusting the spacing between characters, effectively creating additional character spacing. This is effectively a variation of the letter-spacing property.
