                    $$ --
                    The contain property in CSS
                    indicates to the browser that
                    the element and its
                    descendants are considered
                    independent of the document
                    tree as much as possible. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This potentially provides
                    performance benefits with
                    calculations in layout, style,
                    paint, size, or any
                    combination for a limited area
                    of the DOM and not the entire
                    page.

                    Layout: 
                    <p>
                        The layout containment
                        value informs the browser
                        that none of the element’s
                        descendants affect other
                        elements on the page, nor
                        do those other elements
                        have any effect on the
                        descendants of the
                        contained element. <br>
                        This allows the browser to
                        potentially reduce the
                        number of calculations
                        necessary when creating
                        the page layout.

                    Paint :
                    <p>
                        The paint containment
                        value informs the browser
                        that none of the
                        descendants of the element
                        will be painted outside of
                        the border-box of the
                        element. If a descendant
                        element is positioned to
                        have a portion of its
                        bounding box to be clipped
                        by the contained element’s
                        border-box then that
                        portion shall not be
                        painted. If a descendant
                        element is positioned
                        fully outside the
                        contained element’s
                        border-box then it is not
                        painted at all. This is
                        similar to applying
                        overflow: hidden; to the
                        element, but without the
                        benefits of skipping or
                        reducing needed
                        calculations.

                        The size containment value
                        informs the browser that
                        none of the descendants
                        need to be considered when
                        performing layout
                        calculations for the page.
                        The contained element must
                        have height and width
                        properties applied, or it
                        will collapse to zero
                        pixels square. Only the
                        element itself needs to be
                        considered for page layout
                        calculations as
                        descendants cannot
                        influence the size of the
                        element. The contained
                        element’s descendants are
                        completely skipped in such
                        calculations; as if it had
                        no descendants at all.

                        The style containment
                        value informs the browser
                        that some CSS properties,
                        such as counters and
                        quotes, will be scoped to
                        the contained element.

                        The counter-increment and

                        contained element’s
                        sub-tree. If extended
                        outside the contained
                        element then a new counter
                        is created.

                        The content containment

                        both the layout and paint
                        containment values. This
                        is the equivalent of
                        applying containment in
                        this manner:

                        The strict containment
                        value is a combination of
                        the layout, paint, and
                        size containment values.
                        This is the equivalent of
                        applying containment in

                        As the “strictest” of the
                        containment values, this
                        value should be used with
                        careful consideration.
                        This is due to the
                        dimension requirements it
                        imposes on the contained
                        element. With these
                        requirements, this
                        containment value does
                        offer the most potential
                        performance benefits of
                        containment.
