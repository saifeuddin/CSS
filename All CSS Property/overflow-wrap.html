    <h1>CSS overflow-wrap Property</h1>
    <p>
        The overflow-wrap property in CSS allows you to specify that the browser can break a line of text inside the targeted element onto multiple lines in an otherwise unbreakable place. This helps to avoid an unusually long string of text causing layout problems due to overflow.
    </p>
    
    
    
    <h2>CSS Syntax </h2>
    <pre>
    overflow-wrap : normal | break-word;
    </pre>



    <h2>Property Values</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>normal
            <p>
                the default. The browser will break lines according to normal line breaking rules. Words or unbroken strings will not break, even if they overflow the container.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>break-word
            <p>
                words or strings of characters
                that are too large to fit inside
                their container will break in an
                arbitrary place to force a line
                break. A hyphen character will not
                be inserted, even if the hyphens
                property is used.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>
        Similarities to the word-break Property
    </h2>
    <b>
        overflow-wrap
    </b>
    <p>
        is generally used to avoid problems with long strings causing broken layouts due to text flowing outside a container.
    </p>
    <b>
        word-break
    </b>
    <p>
        specifies soft wrap opportunities between letters commonly associated with languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK).
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
        <b>
        From this, we can surmise that
        word-break is best used with
        non-English content that
        requires specific
        word-breaking rules, and that
        might be interspersed with
        English content.
