        <h1>CSS :user-invalid Pseudo Class </h1>    
            <p>
                The :user-invalid is a CSS pseudo-class that is under proposal in the CSS Selectors Level 4 working
                draft that selects a form element based on whether the value—as entered by a user—is valid when checked
                against the what is specified as an accepted value in the HTML markup after the end user has interacted
                with the form beyond that input. In fact, :user-invalid has been called “The User Interaction
                Pseudo-class” because it is unique in identifying a user action in selecting an element.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take HTML markup for a basic form with a numeric field:
            </p>
            <p>
                The numeric range set by the HTML markup for the input is between 1 and 10 but the default value has
                been set to 11. That means the value is invalid as soon as the form loads.
            </p>
            <b>
                However, the :user-invalid pseudo-class will not take effect until after the user has actually
                interacted with the form beyond entering it in the field. That <mark> interaction </mark> is the
                difference between
                :user-invalid and :invalid. The same principle applies for entered form values that are set by
                :in-range, :out-of-range and :required.
